Heritage Odyssey introduces an AI-driven framework designed to enhance visitor engagement through multilingual voice assistance, interactive mapping, personalized recommendations, and budget-friendly planning tools. These features enable tourists to navigate heritage sites efficiently, access real-time insights, and receive culturally rich information in their preferred languages. A mixed-method research approach was adopted, involving keyword mapping and citation network analysis to identify current trends, research gaps, and influential studies in AI-enabled tourism and heritage conservation. The framework was evaluated through simulated user scenarios at selected heritage sites, which revealed that AI supported tools significantly improved visitor satisfaction, accessibility, and the discovery of lesser-known attractions. Additionally, the use of NLP and LLM powered recommendation systems provided dynamic, personalized content tailored to user preferences and real-time data inputs. Despite these benefits, challenges such as data privacy concerns, the need for reliable data sources, and the digital divide faced by smaller heritage sites were identified, emphasizing the need for ongoing research and technological innovation to promote sustainable, inclusive, and AI-enhanced heritage tourism experiences.
